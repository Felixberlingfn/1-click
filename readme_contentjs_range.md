## Important Functions
The following functions have been particularly challenging and I would like to document them for future reference. In particular the getWordRangeFromPoint was quite a revealing challenge and this function could possibly be reused in other contexts or developed further to make it more flexible for different use cases.

## `getWordRangeFromPoint` Function Documentation

### **Overview:**
The `getWordRangeFromPoint` function determines the range of a word located beneath a mouse click on a webpage. Given a mouse event, the function looks up the precise location of the click, then looks for a word that lines up with this location and, if found, returns the range that encapsulates this word.

### **Parameters:**
- `event`: The mouse event object, typically passed from an event listener.

### **Returns:**
- A range object corresponding to the word beneath the mouse click. If no word is found, the function returns `undefined`.

### **Behavior:**
1. **Browser Compatibility**: The function first checks browser capabilities to pinpoint the text beneath the mouse click. It uses `document.caretPositionFromPoint` where available, and as a fallback, uses the WebKit-specific `document.caretRangeFromPoint`.
2. **Text Verification**: Once a range is detected, the function confirms if the content within this range is actually text and possesses any content.
3. **Word Detection**: A regular expression is used to traverse the detected text content and determine the start and end of each word. If the mouse click's position falls within a word, the function updates the range to encapsulate just this word.

### **Additional Notes:**
- While the function was primarily designed with Chrome in mind, it has been structured to be flexible and can potentially support other browsers, given they support either `caretPositionFromPoint` or `caretRangeFromPoint`.

### **Recommendations for Future Development:**
- Keep an eye out for changes and make necessary updates if browser specifications evolve.
- Observe the behavior of the word detection and if necessary make changes.
